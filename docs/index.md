## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture approach:

- **Data Layer**: Handles all data operations and storage
- **Control Plane**: Manages orchestration and coordination  
- **Compute Plane**: Executes ML workloads and processing
- **Management Layer**: Provides cross-cutting concerns
